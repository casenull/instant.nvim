INTRODUCTION                            *instant*

Have you ever wanted to collaborate in real time just like Google Docs?
Now it's possible with instant.nvim in Neovim!

                                        *instant-:InstantStartServer*
 :InstantStartServer {host} {port}
                        Start the built-in server. Optionnally you can specify
                        the {host} and {port}. By default the server will
                        start on 127.0.0.1 on port 8080.

                                        *instant-:InstantStopServer*
 :InstantStopServer     Stop the built-in server along with all its 
                        connections.
                                        *instant-:InstantStartSingle*
 :InstantStartSingle {host} {port}
                        Join the server. The first client to connect should
                        use this command. Subsequent clients should use
                        |:InstantJoinSingle|. This avoids unfortunate
                        buffer overwriting. It only shares the current buffer.

                                        *instant-:InstantJoinSingle*
 :InstantJoinSingle {host} {port}
                        Like |:InstantStartSingle| to join the server if there
                        are already connected client(s).

                                        *instant-:InstantStatus*
 :InstantStatus         Show the connection status.

                                        *instant-:InstantFollow*
 :InstantFollow {username}
                        Follow a user modifications specified by its
                        {username}. To stop following use |:InstantStopFollow|

                                        *instant-:InstantStopFollow*
 :InstantStopFollow     Stop following a user.

                                        *instant-:InstantStartSession*
 :InstantStartSession {host} {port}
                        Similar to |:InstantStartSingle| except it shares all
                        buffers and newly opened buffers.

                                        *instant-:InstantJoinSession*
 :InstantJoinSession {host} {port}
                        Join a session started with |:InstantStartSession| by 
                        a another client.

                                        *instant-:InstantMark*
 :InstantMark           Mark a visually selected region. It sends the
                        mark to other connected clients. If there are 
                        following clients , they will be transported to 
                        the mark.  It is useful to point out code regions 
                        to other clients.

                                        *instant-:InstantMarkClear*
 :InstantMarkClear      Clears all marks.

                                        *instant-:InstantOpenAll*
 :InstantOpenAll        Open all files in the current working directory. This
                        can be used with |:InstantStartSingle| to share the
                        whole directory.

                                        *instant-:InstantSaveAll*
 :InstantSaveAll        Save all opened buffers. Unlike |:wall|, it also
                        creates missing subdirectories.
